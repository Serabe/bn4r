
= Bayesian Networks for Ruby ( bn4r )

bn4r is a bayesian networks library on ruby that provides
the user with classes for create bayesian networks and 
diverse algorithms for solve them.

Its algorithms implementation are based on: S.Russell, P.Norving, "Artificial
Intelligence, A Modern Approach", 2nd Edition.

Rubyforge Project:

= Dependencies

* rgl-0.2.3 ( Ruby Graph Library ), http://rgl.rubyforge.org

= Design principles

The library consists on the object BayesNet thinked to be filled with
BayesNetNode, these objects are defined in bn.rb. BayesNet object is a
especialization of RGL::DirectedAdjacencyGraph ( http://rgl.rubyforge.org ).


The file bn_algorithms.rb has the implementation of the inference algorithms
that can be used to solve BayesNet structures.

Finally, a set of objects and methods are given to automaticly fill BayesNetNode
probabilities tables.
